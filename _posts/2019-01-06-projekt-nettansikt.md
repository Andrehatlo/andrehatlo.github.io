So, i've chosen to start blogging my experiences/insights/thoughts as a developer. Both to learn and to share knowledge.

Trying to find the right platform to start a developer blog was tidies. Google made it hard to find out what the right platform for a simple programming blog and a showcase of my projects. All i saw was **WORDPRESS**.

This was until i stumbled into reddit and found a post about **Jekyll**.

This lightweight, easy to use, multilingual system is a perfect substitution for platforms similar to Wordpress. Using Wordpress, where there is almost no challenge, and you end up paying for something in end anyway.
