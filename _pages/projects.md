</a>

> This thesis explores the different algorithmic possibilities to use for machine learning in an e-commerce environment.
> The goal in this thesis was to find the best case algorithm to solve the problem given by Rørkjøp AS.
> While also constructing an implementation for their system using the best case algorithm.

### My E-commerce site:

(OrientDesign.no)[https://www.orientdesign.no/]

> Running a website thats needs to get traffic and convert customers, pushes me to keep up with all the latest trends in the e-commerce and digital marketing space. Which i find balances well as a developer, since i like to test theories and fine tune my marketing and SEO to see if i can create growth.
