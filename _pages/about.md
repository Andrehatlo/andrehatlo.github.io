I'm a junior developer currently working at Rørkjøp Nett AS with ruby, ruby on rails, postgresql.

My main projects focus on implementing e-commerce solutions too speed up productivity and scaleability.

I live in Drammen Norway with my girlfriend Hilde and my dog Mini.

On my spare time i like to solve problems and watch for the newest trends in my field.

I like to cook, walk my dog and hang out with my better half.
