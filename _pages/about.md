# Hi! I'm André Hatlo-Johansen!

## Professionally:

A junior developer working at Rørkjøp Nett AS for 2 years now.

Hired by for writing a bachelor thesis on [Machine Learning in an E-Commercial Business](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZTvTA2Uo2WnMI_grts0aJcPWlR_Hje06) for Rørkjøp AS, where my main focus in the group was implementing a useable solution for their system. Which i successfully did.

### Technologies utilised:

      - Linux
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Amazon AWS
      - ApacheSpark

    Working here I've become very comfortable with:
      - Slim
      - Scss
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Elasticsearch

The projects I've been assigned are based on creating solutions too speed up productivity and scaleability of Rørkjøp's e-commerce platform.

On my spare time i like to solve puzzles, read, gain knowledge and skill in the different technologies available and watch out for the newest trends in my field.

## On a personal note:

I live in Drammen Norway with my partner and best friend Hilde.

Our love child is a hungry 2 year old 35kg boy named Mini.

I like to cook, ski, keep up with my favourite shows, play with my dog and hang out with my better half.
