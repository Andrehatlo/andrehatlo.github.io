# Hi! I'm André Hatlo-Johansen!

## Professionally:

I'm a junior developer, working for Rørkjøp Nett AS as of 2 years now.

Hired for writing my bachelor thesis on [Machine Learning in an E-Commercial Business](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZTvTA2Uo2WnMI_grts0aJcPWlR_Hje06) for Rørkjøp AS. Where my main focus in the group was implementing a useable solution for their system. Which i successfully did.

### Technologies utilised:

    For thesis:
      - Linux
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Amazon AWS
      - ApacheSpark

    Working here I've become very comfortable with:
      - Slim
      - Scss
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Elasticsearch
      - Heroku

The projects I've been assigned are mostly based on creating solutions too speed up productivity and scaleability of Rørkjøp's e-commerce platform.

On my spare time i like to solve puzzles, read, gain knowledge and skill in the different technologies available and keep an eye open for the newest trends in my field.

## On a personal note:

I live in Drammen Norway with my partner and best friend Hilde.

Our love child is a hungry 2 year old 35kg boy Boxer named Mini.

I like to cook, ski, keep up with my favourite tv-shows, play with my dog and hang out with my better half.

Don't take me too seriously because i don't.


## What i live by:

    1. Don't take life too seriously.

    2. Live each day as it would be your last.

    3. Love what you do, not what you earn.

    4. Make friends, not enemies.

    5. Let the universe do the worrying for you.
