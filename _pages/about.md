# Hi! I'm André Hatlo-Johansen!


## Professionally:

A developer, working for Rørkjøp Nett AS as of 2 years now.

Hired after writing my bachelor thesis on [Machine Learning in an E-Commercial Business](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZTvTA2Uo2WnMI_grts0aJcPWlR_Hje06) for Rørkjøp AS.

On this thesis my main job in the group was to implement a working machine learning solution for Rørkjøp AS.

This entailed setting up a machine learning system that learned by looking at personalised data sets for each unique customer, based on their previous shopping pattern and return personal product recommendations. Which it did successfully.

      - Linux
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Amazon AWS
      - ApacheSpark

      - Ruby
      - Ruby On Rails

      - Postgresql

    Moderately comfortable with:
      - Javascript
      - Elasticsearch
      - Heroku

Projects I've been assigned while working for Rørkjøp are mostly based on creating features too speed up productivity, scaleability or maintainability of Rørkjøp's e-commerce platform.

On my spare time i like to **solve puzzles**, **read**, **gain knowledge** and **skills in different technologies** available while keeping an eye open for new trends to explore.
