# Hi! I'm André Hatlo-Johansen!

I've come to learn over the last years that people are quite different.

This is in respect to the inner essences and personal "powers" that one is born with and eventually with enough self-mastery can harness to its fullest potensial. This came to me after observing my life from a distance, that entailed my own and others thought process, planning process to execution process.

This is why i call my self a **creative engineer**, because I see my self as highly creative in the field of thought, planning and execution. I can hold a room, which means anyone can say anything to me, i dont offend, judge and always give my honest feedback. While also having the mentality to think of solutions to issues for easier and or more perfected solution mastering.

## Creative Engineer

A creative engineer is someone who is abstract and dynamic with creative ideas that flow like a fosset when faced with an issue. They see all threads available to create solutions in the most effective manner possible, while floating close to earth so a project stays in its track.

I am a creative individual comparing myself to those i have worked close with in the last years, and i do all i can to harness this part of myself for the best of my abilities by painting, creating lighting installations and photographing weekly to stay in this part of myself.

This also reflects through in my development process as i adapt like a gecko to any type of syntax or issue i've met.

## My Development Role

In the developer role, I've worked in the E-Commerce field for quite some time. This is where i mastered the art of fullstack development, keeping my fingers in all the waters of the E-Commerce organism we were building at Rørkjøp Nett AS.

Later in life, i moved on to Nordea where i stayed for 2 years, building economic gateways which consisted of structuring API gateways in micro-service frameworks that talk cross and through third-party services.

Also i've built, designed, structured and marketed my private E-Commerce store, where i have for the most part done the total project from design to sale. I love this part of my day since i am creatively free to test and experiment, while economical liberated (on my own dime). This project gives me knowledge in areas i've never thought of learning, which i HIGHLY appreciate.

### Rørkjøp

* Hired after writing a bachelor thesis on [Machine Learning in an E-Commercial Business](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZTvTA2Uo2WnMI_grts0aJcPWlR_Hje06) for Rørkjøp AS.

In the thesis my main work area in the group was to implement a working machine learning solution code base for Rørkjøp AS. This entailed setting up a machine learning system that was taught by looking at customers personalised data sets for each unique customer, based on their previous shopping pattern and return personal product recommendations.

    Technologies utilised:
      - Linux
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - Postgresql
      - Amazon AWS
      - ApacheSpark

#### Comfortablity levels:

     Very:
      - Ruby
      - Ruby On Rails
      - Rspec
      - Slim
      - Scss
      - Postgresql

    Moderately:
      - Javascript
      - Elasticsearch
      - Heroku

Projects assigned while working for Rørkjøp were for the most part based on building functionality to speed up productivity, scalability or maintainability of Rørkjøp's E-Commerce and CMS platform. I was very happy to work at Rørkjøp as i got the freedom to choose my projects and develop them in my own pace.

It was hard work coming from basically no coding knowledge to be able to develop my last project for Rørkjøp, a ETL system (Extract, Transfer, Load), which basically is a way of automating a database migration/importing process.  

I must say I LOVED my time there, a challange worth the sweat and tears it took to speed up my knowledge and intellect in the development world.

#### Nordea AS

At Nordea AS i was stationed mostly backend, building micro-service API's that communicated with third party services to add features such as payment, adding balance to an account and loans. Working at Nordea I utilised Java foremost with reactive libraries to create rich streaming applications:

Technologies used at Nordea AS:

- Java
  - RxJava library
  - Reactor
  - SpringBoot
- Maven
- SQL
- IntelliJ (IDE)

### Other skills:

    - Javascript (Intermediate) = React/Node.js/etc
    - HTML (Advanced)
    - CSS/SCSS  (Advanced)
    - Linux/Windows/iOS (Advanced)

## Other information:

On my spare time i like to **solve puzzles**, **read**, **gain knowledge** and **skills in different technologies** available while keeping an eye open for new trends to explore.

### E-Commerce and Digital Marketing

Having my own E-Commerce site and doing my best to gain organic growth has made me efficient at SEO and website structuring for website traffic. Which again forces me to be creative and use some of my spare time to write articles about subjects that i've never thought about.

Also i am very comfortable with Facebook Ads and Google Ads, which i've used to convert customers.

## On a personal note:

I'm a 29 year old man who both loves a good laugh, having a good time and values my time.

At the moment I live in Drammen Norway with my bestfriend/girlfriend and Mini.

I have a super funny 40kilo, three year old boxer named **Mini**.

## I have Hobbies!

- Improv - Once a week! Which i LOVE, keeps my social mind sharp
- Cooking - I love to both make food and eat, nomnom
- Dog walks/play - This is where most of my best thinking comes through, the most creative part of me.
- Keeping up with my favourite tv-shows. (not the Kardashians)
- Playing some computer games still.
- Yoga is something i practise religiously as i've benefited so much from it.

## Phrases i live by:

1. Don't take life too seriously, have fun while it lasts.

2. Love what you do and live each day as it would be your last.

3. Serve humanity by leaving the earth an ounce better than when you came.

4. Make friends, not enemies, else kill them with kindness.

5. Let the universe do the worrying for you, anxiety gets you nowhere.

6. Last but not least, live in the now, which is all that actually exists, then enjoy the ride.
   - You only get **ONE!**

# Hope this leaves an impression worth considering for your next project, i create solutions for anything.
