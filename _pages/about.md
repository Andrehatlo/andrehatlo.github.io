# Hi! I'm André Hatlo-Johansen!

I've come to understand over the last years that people are quite different. This is in respect to the inner essences and personal "powers" that one is born with. This came to me after observing a teams thought process, planning process to execution process. That's why i call my self a **creative engineer**, because I see my self as unique in that field of thought, planning and execution to be the most creative in the room while also having the mentality to think of solutions to issues for the easier or more perfected solution to a issue.

## Create Engineer

A creative engineer is someone who is abstract and dynamic with creative ideas that flow like a fosset when faced with an issue. They see all threads available to create in the most effective manner possible, while floating close to earth so a project stays in its track.

I am a highly creative and i do all i can to harness this part of myself for the best of my abilities by painting, creating installations and photographing/photoshopping weekly to stay in this part of myself.

This also reflects through in my development process as i adapt like a gecko to any type of syntax or issue i've met.

## Professionally:

As a developer, I've worked in the E-Commerce field for quite some time, for Rørkjøp Nett AS for 2 years, and worked on a WebBank project for Nordea for about 1 year which entailed building API micro-services. While also keeping my own store open and updated with sales at all times.

### Rørkjøp

Rørkjøp hired me after writing my bachelor thesis on [Machine Learning in an E-Commercial Business](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZTvTA2Uo2WnMI_grts0aJcPWlR_Hje06) for Rørkjøp AS. On this thesis my main job in the group was to implement a working machine learning solution for Rørkjøp AS. This entailed setting up a machine learning system that learned by looking at personalised data sets for each unique customer, based on their previous shopping pattern and return personal product recommendations. Which it did successfully.

Projects I've been assigned while working for Rørkjøp are mostly based on creating features too speed up productivity, scalability or maintainability of Rørkjøp's E-Commerce and CMS platform.

#### Nordea AS

### E-Commerce and Digital Marketing

Having my own E-Commerce site and doing my best to gain organic growth has made me efficient at SEO and website structuring for website traffic. Which again forces me to be creative and use some of my spare time to write articles about subjects that i've never thought about.

Also i am very comfortable with Facebook Ads and Google Ads, which i've used to convert customers.
